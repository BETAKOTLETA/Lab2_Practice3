### The goal of the task is to:
- practice creating extension methods in C#

### Steps
1. Fork the repo to have your own copy and then clone it to your local disc
2. Open IntExtensionsTests.cs. Select all its content and uncomment it. Go to the IntExtensions.cs and implement missing features (ToOrdinal and IsPrime) so that all the tests in IntExtensionsTests.cs pass.
3. Open StringExtensionsTests.cs. Select all its content and uncomment it. Go to the StringExtensions.cs and implement missing features (ToSnakeCase) so that all the tests in StringExtensionsTests.cs pass.
